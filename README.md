# 🛠️ Boltaeva Cosmetic — Admin Panel (Node.js + MongoDB)

This is the backend admin panel for the **Boltaeva Cosmetic** project, built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.  
It allows administrators to manage product data — including adding, editing, and deleting items — via a basic web interface.

The application uses **MongoDB** as a database to store and retrieve product information.
